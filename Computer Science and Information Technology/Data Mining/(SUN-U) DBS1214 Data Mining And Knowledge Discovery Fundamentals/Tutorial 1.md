For the following scenario as a mini case study, if there is no prior knowledge, obtain the background information to gain domain knowledge by conducting preliminary research to understand possible data sources and potential constraints for the scenario and real-world facts related to the scenario. 
Then using the concept learned in Problem Understanding for data mining, propose a sensible data mining objective for each scenario and state assumptions made (i.e., assume what kind of data should be available and if there are any potential constraints). 

1. An airline wants to predict flight delays to improve customer satisfaction.  

2. To reduce the dropout rate, a university wants to predict which students are at risk of dropping out.  

3. A marketing firm wants to segment its customer base to improve targeted marketing efforts.
